                <h2>Workout 1: dumbbell press shoulder</h2>
                <p>What is a shoulder press? The shoulder press is one of the best exercises for strengthening your shoulders and upper back. The biggest benefactor of the shoulder press is the front portion of your shoulder muscle (anterior deltoid) but you'll also be working out your deltoids, triceps, trapezius and pecs. </p>

                <h2>Workout 3: face pull</h2>
                <p>Face pulls are quite diverse in terms of the muscles that they exercise. First and foremost, your posterior deltoids or rear shoulder muscles are worked out heavily during this exercise and are perhaps the number one most engaged muscle. Your rotator cuff, lateral deltoids, and traps also get engaged here.</p>
